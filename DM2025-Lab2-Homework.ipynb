The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",
