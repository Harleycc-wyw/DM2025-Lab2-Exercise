        "We've already seen how to get structured data from LLMs using techniques like structured prompting and function calling. These methods are powerful for turning an LLM's understanding into a machine-readable format. However, as we build more complex applications, two critical challenges emerge: **trust** and **scalability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Trust and Verifiability (Grounding):** How can we be sure the information an LLM provides is accurate and actually comes from the source text we gave it? LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or infer information that isn't present. **Grounding** is the process of linking every piece of extracted data directly back to its specific origin in the source document. This creates a verifiable audit trail, allowing a human or another system to confirm the information's source, which is essential in high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, and legal analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Scalability and Reliability (Extraction):** While function calling is excellent for specific tasks, building a robust pipeline to extract complex information from long, messy documents requires a more specialized approach. We need a system that can handle large texts, consistently enforce a desired output schema across thousands of documents, and make the results easy for humans to review.\n",
        "\n",

        "Google's open-source Python library, `langextract`, is designed specifically to solve these problems. It uses the power of LLMs to convert unstructured text into structured data, with a strong emphasis on reliability and traceability. Instead of just getting a JSON object, `langextract` provides a complete solution for building trustworthy extraction pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are its key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Precise Source Grounding:** This is the library's core strength. Every single piece of extracted data is mapped to its exact character position in the original text. This means you can always trace an output back to its source, building trust and allowing for easy verification.\n",
        "*   **Reliable Structured Outputs:** We define the structure of our desired output by providing a few examples (few-shot prompting). `langextract` uses these examples to guide the LLM, ensuring the output consistently follows our defined schema. This makes the data clean, predictable, and ready for analysis or storage.\n",
        "*   **Adaptable to Any Domain without Fine-Tuning:** We don't need to collect a large dataset or retrain a model. By simply changing our natural language instructions and examples, you can adapt `langextract` to new domains, whether it's extracting clinical data from medical notes, key clauses from legal contracts, or financial figures from earnings reports.\n",
        "*   **Optimized for Long Documents:** The library is built to handle lengthy texts that might exceed a standard LLM's context window. It employs smart chunking and multi-pass strategies to effectively find \"needles in a haystack\" within large documents.\n",
        "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** `langextract` is model-agnostic. While it's optimized for powerful models like Google's Gemini or OpenAI models, it also supports local, open-source models (via Ollama), or even custom providers, giving us the flexibility to balance performance, cost, and data privacy.\n",

Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (e.g., embeddinggemma). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM (e.g. gemma3:270m) generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate."

These embeddings, like we have already seen in the lab, capture the semantic meaning and relationships between words, phrases, or even entire documents by mapping them into a high-dimensional space where similar pieces of text are placed closer together. What makes LLM embeddings special is that they are contextual and rich in meaning, meaning the same word can have different embeddings based on its surrounding context.\n",

KNN is non-parametric, meaning it doesn’t assume a specific form for the underlying data distribution, and it classifies points based on their similarity to other points in the training set. It's easy to understand and implement, though it can become computationally expensive with large datasets."

        "Few-shot prompting classification for LLMs involves giving the model a few labeled examples (typically 5 or fewer) within a prompt to guide it in performing a classification task. Instead of needing extensive training, the LLM uses these examples to understand the task and classify new inputs. This approach is significant in current research because it allows LLMs to perform well on tasks with minimal labeled data, reducing the need for large training datasets and making it highly flexible for various NLP tasks, including those in low-resource languages or niche domains.\n",
